# Project Movies

This week we have created a multi page React application that shows popular movies fetched from an API.

## The problem

We had issues with understading how useParam works which led to problems in showing detailed information in one of our components.  
The problem was solved with the help from one of our group members and townhall. 

Our plan from the beginning was to have a solid structure and then work from there step by step. 
We created three components of which one was the main component where we used all logic, the purpose was to keep the app.js clean from code. 


If we had more time (read: energy) we would try the styled components and also spend more time on the CSS.
